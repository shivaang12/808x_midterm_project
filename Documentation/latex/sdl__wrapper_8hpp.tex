D\+E\+S\+C\+R\+I\+P\+T\+I\+ON Header file for the class \char`\"{}\+Sdl\+\_\+wrapper\char`\"{}. This class act as wrapper of original S\+DL library for C++. It encaptulates enough functionality from the library for visual of environment, on which B\+FS has been used, and path it has generated. Information about path and environment, obstacles and space size, will be recieved externally from \hyperlink{class_obstacle__generator}{Obstacle\+\_\+generator} class and this will generate visuals accordingly.
